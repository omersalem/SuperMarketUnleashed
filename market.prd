# Project Instructions for Supermarket Management Website Development

## General Guidelines
- The project development follows a strict module-based iterative approach.
- Work on **one functional module at a time**. Do not start the next module until the current one is complete and approved.
- This is a **web application only**, not an APK or mobile app.
- Use **React** with **Tailwind CSS** for frontend development.
- Use **Context7 MCP** to always get the latest documentation for all technologies used.
- Use **Firebase Free Tier** for Authentication and Database.
- Support both **Arabic and English languages** with proper internationalization (i18n).
- The website should be **fully responsive** and work well on PCs, tablets, and phones.
- Apply the UI design strictly from the `design.md` file.
- Manage two user roles:  
  - **Admin**: full access including edits.  
  - **User**: view-only access for invoices.
- The "Workers" module manages workers data (loans, salaries) without authentication accounts.
- Avoid using Kotlin or Node.js.
- The codebase should be clean, easy to extend, and maintain.
- After completing each task, **run tests to verify functionality** before proceeding.
- Remove any dead or unused code after each task to keep the code clean.
- Document every completed module in `memory.md` with notes about functionality and tests done.
- Each change must be tested and verified before moving on.

## Development Workflow per Module
1. Plan the module and explain your intended approach with the exact files you will create or modify.
2. Develop the moduleâ€™s functionality fully.
3. Implement tests validating the module's features work as expected.
4. Refactor and clean the code, removing redundant or unused parts.
5. Update `memory.md` with a detailed progress note about the module, including test results.
6. Present the completed module and wait for user approval before moving to the next.

## Communication with User
- Present design layouts initially for user approval.
- Ask for explicit user approval before starting any code writing operation.
- Always wait for feedback and confirmation before progressing.

This setup ensures quality, maintainability, bilingual support, responsiveness, and clear communication throughout the web app development.
